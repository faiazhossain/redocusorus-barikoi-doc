## Create an Android Studio project

Familiarize yourself with Android Studio. You'll need to create a new project with an empty activity. Use the following options when creating a new Android Studio project:

- Under Select the form factors your app will run on, check "Phone and Tablet.

- For minimum SDK, select API 16: Android 4.1 (JellyBean). (This is the lowest API level currently supported by Barikoi Location Library for Android.)

- Click Next to advance to the activity selection screen.

- Select Empty Activity and click Next.

- Accept the default Activity Name and Layout Name and click Finish.
